## Description

My Aircraft Hangar is a web application built with Python and Django that allows aviation enthusiasts, hobbyists, and pilots to securely manage their personal model aircraft collections. Users can register, log in, and perform full CRUD operations on their aircraft, including uploading images, tracking details like model, manufacturer, and condition, and viewing their fleet in a clean, responsive grid layout.

The appâ€™s purpose is to provide a lightweight, user-friendly tool for organizing and maintaining aircraft records. Stretch features include maintenance logs for tracking service history, making it a practical solution for both personal enjoyment and real-world aerospace relevance.
